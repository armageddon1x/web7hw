		<br>
		<p>
			The Astronomy Society Team, a suborganization of the larger Advocacy for Science and Technology, is a group of very dedicated astronomers, cosmologists, and laypeople that work hard to promote astronomy research and funding to the public. There are branches all over the United States that raise up both money and interest for projects such as the new Moon missions, the exploration of the Kuiper Belt, and biological research about the International Space Station. The fundraisers work to gather additional funds to organizations like NASA and the National Science Foundation (NSF), in addition to the gov't funds.
		</p> 
		<hr>
		<p>
			the AST also uses grassroots campaigning to inform the public of the good that comes both from astronomical research and engineering hurdles overcome in these space missions. With an informed public, we hope to have the political voice to increase budgets to not only NASA and other astronimical research, but to other scientific research activities as well. After all, in the end, we all benefit from the hard work of these brave scientists.
		</p>
		<hr>
		<p>
			Through the hard work of both professional and amateur astronomers, as well as other people with the same goal of more science funding, we can help expand the scientific endeavors done by NASA and other science organizations. We ask if you would donate some money to astronomy and ultimately, to our greater understanding of our universe and our place on this small blue dot of ours we call "Earth".
