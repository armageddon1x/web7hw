			Science funding is very fruitful and we not only learn a lot from new discoveries but also create new technologies along the way. However, all this research is expensive, and science budgets are one of the first things to go when it comes time to trim the budget. NASA has had to scrap several of its programs because of lack of funding. Other projects are delayed as well. It is important to have enough funding to keep research going. So we ask you on behalf of AST and all the astronomers and other scientists doing research, to donate a little bit so that we can all enjoy the fruits of this labor. If everyone donates 10 dollars, NASA can have enough money to fly back to the moon. Who knows, with more funding, going to Mars may be more than a dream.
