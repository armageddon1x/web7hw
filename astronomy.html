		<h1>In The Beginning...</h1>
		<br>
		<p>
			Astronomy is as old as human civilization itself. The first astronomers were the ones who gazed at the stars and wondered what they were. Of course, astronomy is much more advanced today, but the wonder that first made us look at the sky and study it is the same.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the beginning, people looked up at the sky to study the stars and the patterns they had. Some stars, like the ones that form the constellation Orion, only come up at certain times. From there, they could determine what time was best to plant crops or prepare for other phenomena, like how the Egyptians predicted the flooding of the Nile. As astronomy became more sophisticated, it became part of religious belief. The astronomers were also usually part of the religious class and the highly educated of the time. This helped the people know when certain religious practices were to be held. In this way, astronomy impacted human culture in an important way.

		<p>
			The Sumerians, Babylonians, and other ancient people pioneered the science of astronomy. The Greeks and Romans continued this trend as they studied the stars in depth. Other civilizations, like the Egyptians, Mayans, and ancient Aryans, studied the stars with the same fervor and accuracy.  These civilizations developed better techniques to calculate and predict celestial behavoir. The names we use for the stars and the star groupings come down to us from the Greeks.
		</p>
		<p>
			As time passed, the science became even more sophisticated. Arab and European scholars in the Middle Ages developed even more techniques and made better predictions. Kepler and Galileo in the Renaissance period revolutionized how we thought of the universe. And as time progressed, and technology became better, we discovered more and more things about the universe. Nowadays we use more powerful telescopes and more advanced physics to make theories, models, and predictions. But same wonder that we get from observing universe the ancients had is still within us.
